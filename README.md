# Drop-UIKit-
This was my final project for iOS Development #3 Spring Semester. This project was meant to be a portfolio piece with little to no restrictions. This application is a release tracker for clothing items. Users are able to create drops and set reminders along with adding items to a user closet where they can sort through their collection. The following techniques were used throughout the project: 

* UITableView
* Diffable Data Source
* Core Data
* Notification Center
* Camera
* WebKit
* Custom Animations
